# 🧠 Reflection on the ODI Cricket Data Analysis Project

Working on the ODI Cricket Data Analysis project was one of the most enjoyable and insightful parts of my analytics journey because it allowed me to combine two things I genuinely enjoy — cricket and data storytelling. Analyzing player statistics and match trends over more than two decades helped me appreciate how sports analytics can uncover patterns that are not always visible during a match but become clear through structured exploration.

During the data cleaning process, I realized how inconsistent formats, missing innings details, and player-level variations can significantly affect the quality of insights. Using Excel and Power Query to organize batting, bowling, and match-level statistics strengthened my ability to work with large, multi-sheet datasets and transform them into a unified analytical model.

Building dashboards allowed me to translate raw performance numbers into clear visuals that highlighted trends such as the rise of aggressive batting post-2015, the stability of certain bowlers across different conditions, and how innings totals impact win probability. Seeing these patterns emerge made me appreciate how data can reveal the underlying dynamics that shape match outcomes.

This project also improved my ability to think critically about metrics — like strike rate, economy, and role classification — and how they contribute to evaluating player performance holistically. It reinforced the importance of choosing the right features, interpreting correlations carefully, and presenting results in a way that connects both to cricket fans and analytical audiences.

As a student of Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics, this project helped me strengthen my foundational skills in descriptive analytics and dashboard creation. It also sparked ideas for future enhancements like predictive modeling, win probability simulations, and machine learning-based player comparisons.

Overall, this project deepened my confidence in data analysis, strengthened my visualization skills, and showed me how even something as passion-driven as cricket can become a meaningful data narrative when explored with curiosity and structure.
