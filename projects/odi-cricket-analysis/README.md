# 🏏 ODI Cricket Data Analysis (2002–2023)

### 📊 Performance Insights, Player Metrics, and Match-Level Analytics

This project analyzes **two decades of ODI cricket data** to uncover patterns in player performance, match dynamics, and batting/bowling efficiency.  
It demonstrates my ability to combine **data cleaning, feature engineering, pivot-table modeling, and Excel-based visualization** to translate raw sports data into meaningful insights.

## 🧠 Project Overview

- **Goal:** To analyze ODI cricket data (2002–2023) and derive actionable insights about batting, bowling, innings performance, strike rates, economy rates, and match outcomes.
- **Dataset:** Public ODI match and player datasets collected for educational analysis  
- **Tools Used:**  
  - Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers)  
  - Power Query (Data cleaning & transformation)  
  - Basic statistical analysis  
  - Optional Python (for exploratory extensions)

## ⚙️ Key Steps in the Analysis

### **1. Data Cleaning & Processing**
- Removed inconsistencies in match IDs and player names  
- Standardized date formats and country abbreviations  
- Power Query used to split innings data, remove null records, and fix numeric formats  

### **2. Feature Engineering**
Created newly derived fields:
- **Strike Rate**, **Balls Faced**, **Overs Bowled**, **Economy Rate**
- **Role Guessing** (Batter, Bowler, All-rounder) based on performance metrics  
- **Match-Innings Summary** for total runs, wickets fallen, extras, and batting order  

### **3. Visualizations & Dashboards**
Using Excel Pivot Tables and Charts:
- Top run scorers and wicket takers  
- Strike rate vs. batting position  
- Economy trends of key bowlers  
- Team-wise performance patterns  
- Year-over-year batting and bowling metrics  
- Match innings summaries (Totals, Extras, Wickets)
