# 🧠 Reflection on the Video Sales Analysis Project

Working on the Video Sales Analysis project gave me an opportunity to connect data analytics with real-world business insights in a domain that is constantly evolving — the global gaming industry. As I explored the dataset, I realized how regional preferences, platform generations, and genre popularity play a significant role in shaping overall sales performance. This helped me appreciate how consumer behavior data can tell a much deeper story when analyzed correctly.

Cleaning and preparing the dataset using Excel and Power Query reinforced the importance of starting any analysis with a strong data foundation. Small inconsistencies in platform names or missing values can completely shift the accuracy of visualizations and insights. Designing pivot tables and charts allowed me to organize the data in a way that was interactive, visually appealing, and easy to interpret.

One of the most impactful parts of this project was identifying patterns such as the rise of certain genres in global markets, Japan’s unique preference for role-playing games, and how platform life cycles influence sales peaks. These findings strengthened my understanding of how data-driven decisions are made in entertainment and tech industries.

This project also improved my ability to present insights clearly, combining visuals with narrative explanations. It helped me see how even a non-technical audience can benefit from a well-designed dashboard that highlights the “why” behind the numbers. As someone pursuing a Master’s in Artificial Intelligence (Data Analytics), this project supports my growth in descriptive analytics, preparing me for more advanced predictive and prescriptive techniques.

Overall, this analysis strengthened my confidence in Excel-based visual analytics, sharpened my storytelling abilities, and reminded me that meaningful insights come from curiosity, structure, and thoughtful interpretation.
